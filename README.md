# 👋 Hello, I'm Roman!


## 👨🏻‍💻🎸🇯🇵 About Me 

I'm a mechanical/mechatronical engineer based in Vienna. I have a passion for numerical computing, music, and the Japanese language.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning (or better, always) C++, modern Fortran, and recently a little bit of Rust
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on numerical computing projects (especially methods to solve partial differential equations) and also musical projects involving electric guitar.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with methods that assist in computing and optimizing a block diagonal (ordered) real Schur decomposition.
